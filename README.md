##TexStudio
To install this color scheme you need to open the TexStudio config file.  
Its called texstudio.ini. The default paths are:  
- **Linux/Unix/Mac:** ~/.config/texstudio/texstudio.ini
- **Windows:** %APPDATA%\texstudio\texstudio.ini  

Now just Copy the TexStudioBlack.txt and paste it to [Formats] at the end of your .ini file. 
  
**Note:**

        TeXstudio has to be closed while editing texstudio.ini.  
        Otherwise the changes won't have any effect and will be overwritten when TeXstudio is closed.
